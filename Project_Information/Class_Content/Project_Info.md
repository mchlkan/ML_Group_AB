• How to evaluate the project?
• Each group needs to propose and explore a dataset to present a non-obvious, compelling story using a
notebook/dashboard (if you need, we have some exemplary datasets! Let me know!)
• Please submit the group elements, topic and dataset by 11/02 by email for feedback (if you don’t have a
group let me know by 10/02)
• Students are responsible to structure the analysis and decide and evaluate different machine learning
techniques to be used. The course project will be discussed with and evaluated by the instructor/TA.
• The final delivered project should be a complete machine learning pipeline (python notebook) with different
algorithms and: report, video and code (check details on syllabus)
• Each student is expected to perform analysis and should be able to explain the project
