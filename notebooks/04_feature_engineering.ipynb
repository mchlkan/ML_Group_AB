    "# Feature Engineering Specification — Spotify Cross-Border Diffusion Model\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prediction Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to model the **cross-border diffusion of tracks across Spotify markets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each track and each possible target country, we predict:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification task:**  \n",
    "  `did_enter_target_country` → Will the track ever chart in this country?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression task:**  \n",
    "  `days_to_enter_target_country` → How many days after the reference point will it chart there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the training dataset represents one prediction scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(track_id, target_country, reference_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulates making a prediction at a specific moment in time, using only information available at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Reference Time Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We define:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "reference_time = first global chart appearance of the track (Top 200 only)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT track_id, MIN(date) AS reference_time\n",
    "FROM spotify_data\n",
    "WHERE chart = 'top200'\n",
    "GROUP BY track_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this reference time is chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment, the following information is **known**:\n",
    "- Track intrinsic properties\n",
    "- Artist historical performance\n",
    "- Market characteristics\n",
    "- Origin country (first chart appearance)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment, the following information is **NOT yet known**:\n",
    "- Whether the track will enter other countries later\n",
    "- When it will enter other countries\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the model does not use future information and prevents temporal leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Categories Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineer features in the following logical groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| Identifiers and targets | Define training dataset structure |\n",
    "| Track intrinsic features | Describe inherent properties of the track |\n",
    "| Artist features | Capture artist strength and global reach |\n",
    "| Diffusion state features | Capture how far the track has already spread |\n",
    "| Target country features | Describe structural properties of the destination market |\n",
    "| Geographic relationship features | Describe relationship between origin and target country |\n",
    "| Temporal features | Capture seasonal timing effects |\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "track attractiveness × artist strength × current diffusion state × market receptiveness × geographic proximity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
